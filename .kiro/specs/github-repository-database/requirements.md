# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a GitHub Repository Database system designed to support the Knowledge Arbitrage project. The system will systematically ingest, catalog, and analyze high-quality open-source codebases to extract engineering wisdom across the L1-L8 hierarchy. The database will serve as the foundation for creating specialized training datasets and identifying optimization opportunities in the Rust ecosystem.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a systems programming researcher, I want to systematically discover and catalog high-quality GitHub repositories, so that I can build a comprehensive database of stellar codebases for analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides repository selection criteria THEN the system SHALL automatically discover repositories matching those criteria from GitHub's API
2. WHEN repositories are discovered THEN the system SHALL extract and store comprehensive metadata including stars, forks, language composition, commit activity, and contributor information
3. WHEN a repository is added to the database THEN the system SHALL assign it to appropriate categories (OS Kernels, Databases, Runtimes, Historical Systems, etc.)
4. IF a repository meets quality thresholds (configurable star count, activity level, code quality metrics) THEN the system SHALL prioritize it for analysis
5. WHEN duplicate repositories are encountered THEN the system SHALL merge or deduplicate entries intelligently

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a code archaeologist, I want to ingest complete repository histories including commits, issues, and pull requests, so that I can perform L8 meta-context extraction on the decision-making process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a repository is selected for ingestion THEN the system SHALL clone the complete Git history including all branches and tags
2. WHEN ingesting repository data THEN the system SHALL fetch and store all GitHub issues, pull requests, and their associated discussions
3. WHEN processing commit history THEN the system SHALL extract commit messages, diffs, and link them to related issues/PRs
4. WHEN storing historical data THEN the system SHALL preserve temporal relationships and maintain referential integrity
5. IF API rate limits are encountered THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent backoff and queuing strategies
6. WHEN ingestion is complete THEN the system SHALL verify data completeness and flag any missing components

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a performance optimization researcher, I want to analyze code patterns and architectural decisions across multiple repositories, so that I can identify high-leverage optimization opportunities for Rust.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing repository code THEN the system SHALL extract and categorize code patterns according to the L1-L8 hierarchy
2. WHEN processing source code THEN the system SHALL identify performance-critical sections, concurrency patterns, and memory management strategies
3. WHEN analyzing architectural decisions THEN the system SHALL cross-reference code changes with issue discussions to understand the reasoning
4. WHEN extracting patterns THEN the system SHALL tag them with relevant domains (networking, databases, compilers, etc.)
5. WHEN pattern analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate structured data suitable for LLM training datasets
6. IF similar patterns are found across repositories THEN the system SHALL identify and highlight cross-pollination opportunities

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a dataset curator, I want to export analyzed repository data in structured formats, so that I can create specialized training datasets for LLM fine-tuning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL provide multiple output formats (JSON, JSONL, Parquet, CSV)
2. WHEN generating training data THEN the system SHALL structure it according to configurable schemas optimized for different LLM architectures
3. WHEN creating datasets THEN the system SHALL include proper attribution and licensing information for each code snippet
4. WHEN exporting analysis results THEN the system SHALL maintain traceability back to original source repositories and commits
5. IF privacy or licensing concerns exist THEN the system SHALL provide filtering and anonymization capabilities
6. WHEN datasets are generated THEN the system SHALL validate data quality and completeness before export

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a research project manager, I want to track analysis progress and manage repository priorities, so that I can efficiently allocate LLM credits and focus on high-impact codebases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing the repository queue THEN the system SHALL provide priority scoring based on configurable criteria (quality, uniqueness, strategic value)
2. WHEN tracking progress THEN the system SHALL maintain status for each repository (discovered, ingested, analyzed, exported)
3. WHEN monitoring resource usage THEN the system SHALL track API calls, storage consumption, and processing time
4. WHEN prioritizing analysis THEN the system SHALL support manual overrides and custom scoring algorithms
5. IF analysis fails or is incomplete THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error reporting and retry mechanisms
6. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide analytics on coverage, progress, and resource utilization

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a systems architect, I want the database to scale efficiently and handle large volumes of repository data, so that I can analyze hundreds of repositories without performance degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing repository data THEN the system SHALL use efficient data structures and indexing strategies
2. WHEN processing large repositories THEN the system SHALL implement streaming and chunked processing to manage memory usage
3. WHEN handling concurrent operations THEN the system SHALL support parallel ingestion and analysis of multiple repositories
4. WHEN scaling storage THEN the system SHALL support both local and cloud storage backends
5. IF system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent caching and data lifecycle management
6. WHEN querying data THEN the system SHALL provide fast search and filtering capabilities across all stored metadata

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security-conscious researcher, I want to safely analyze potentially untrusted code repositories, so that I can extract insights without compromising system security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cloning repositories THEN the system SHALL implement sandboxing to prevent malicious code execution
2. WHEN processing repository content THEN the system SHALL scan for and quarantine potentially dangerous files
3. WHEN analyzing code THEN the system SHALL use static analysis techniques that don't require code execution
4. WHEN storing sensitive data THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate encryption and access controls
5. IF suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and halt processing
6. WHEN handling credentials THEN the system SHALL use secure storage and rotation mechanisms for API tokens
